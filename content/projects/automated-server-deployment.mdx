# Automated Server Deployment Pipeline

## Project Overview

Designed and implemented a fully automated server deployment pipeline that reduced deployment time from hours to minutes while ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

## Architecture

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning
- **Ansible** for configuration management
- **Docker** for application containerization
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD orchestration

### Multi-Environment Strategy
\`\`\`
Development → Staging → Production
     ↓           ↓          ↓
   Auto Deploy  Manual    Manual
               Approval   Approval
\`\`\`

## Implementation Details

### 1. Infrastructure Provisioning
```hcl
# Terraform configuration for AWS EC2 instances
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  count         = var.instance_count
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "web-server-${count.index + 1}"
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}
