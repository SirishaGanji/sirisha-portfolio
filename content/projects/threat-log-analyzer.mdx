summary: "Parses security logs and classifies incidents by severity and likely root cause using AI tagging."

## Overview
This tool ingests raw security logs (CSV / JSON / plain text), normalizes fields, and uses AI-powered tagging to label each record by **severity**, **category** (e.g., auth, network, endpoint), and **likely root cause**.

## Key Features
- Automated parsing (Regex + Pandas) for mixed log formats  
- AI tagging (LLM prompts) for **severity** and **category**  
- Export to CSV with tags & confidence  
- Filters for time range, host, user, category  

## How it Works
1. **Normalize**: Clean and structure logs (timestamps, hosts, users, IPs).  
2. **Tag**: Send compact context chunks to the model for severity/root-cause tags.  
3. **Review**: Output includes confidence scores and rationales.

## Results
Reduces manual triage time by ~60% in small SOC workflows.
