# Enterprise Network Security Audit

## Project Overview

This comprehensive security audit was conducted for a mid-size enterprise with over 500 employees and complex network infrastructure spanning multiple locations. The project involved identifying vulnerabilities, assessing risks, and implementing robust security measures.

## Methodology

### 1. Reconnaissance Phase
- Network mapping using Nmap and custom scripts
- Asset discovery and inventory compilation
- Service enumeration and version detection

### 2. Vulnerability Assessment
- Automated scanning with Nessus and OpenVAS
- Manual testing of critical systems
- Configuration review of network devices

### 3. Penetration Testing
- Simulated attacks on identified vulnerabilities
- Social engineering assessments
- Physical security evaluation

## Key Findings

### Critical Vulnerabilities
- **Unpatched Windows Servers**: 15 servers running outdated operating systems
- **Weak Authentication**: Default credentials on network devices
- **Insecure Protocols**: Legacy systems using unencrypted communication

### Risk Assessment
The audit revealed a **High** overall risk level with immediate action required for:
- Critical system patching
- Network segmentation implementation
- Access control improvements

## Remediation Strategy

### Immediate Actions (0-30 days)
1. Emergency patching of critical vulnerabilities
2. Password policy enforcement
3. Disable unnecessary services

### Short-term Goals (1-3 months)
1. Network segmentation implementation
2. Multi-factor authentication deployment
3. Security monitoring enhancement

### Long-term Objectives (3-12 months)
1. Zero-trust architecture implementation
2. Security awareness training program
3. Regular penetration testing schedule

## Tools and Technologies

- **Nmap**: Network discovery and security auditing
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analyzer
- **Metasploit**: Penetration testing framework
- **Nessus**: Vulnerability scanner
- **Python**: Custom automation scripts

## Results and Impact

The security audit resulted in:
- **85% reduction** in critical vulnerabilities
- **99.5% network uptime** maintained during remediation
- **Zero security incidents** in the 6 months following implementation

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the importance of:
- Regular security assessments
- Proactive vulnerability management
- Employee security awareness training
- Continuous monitoring and improvement
